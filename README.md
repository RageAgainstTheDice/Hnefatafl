# Hnefatafl
My final project/game for my university's Intro to Game Programming course (CSC329) and my largest programming project to date

[Click here](Hnefatafl/Assets/Documentation/HnefataflDocumentation.pdf) to see the game's documentation, which includes both a bit of background information plus the rules of play (this file is also accessible from the game itsel via the "Rules in Detail" button in the title screen).
