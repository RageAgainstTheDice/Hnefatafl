# Hnefatafl
My final project/game for my university's Intro to Game Programming course (CSC329) and my largest programming project to date

[Click here](Hnefatafl/Assets/Documentation/HnefataflDocumentation.pdf) to see the game's documentation, which includes both a bit of background information plus the rules of play (this file is also accessible from the game itsel via the "Rules in Detail" button in the title screen).

[Click here](Hnefatafl.pdf) to see a pdf version of the slideshow I used to present my project, which includes all the asset credits (be sure to click "More Pages" at the bottom to see the whole thing).
